                    <h2>Chandrayaan-3</h2>
                    <p>Chandrayaan-3 ,is the third Indian lunar exploration mission under the Indian Space Research
                        Organisation's (ISRO) Chandrayaan programme. It consists of a lander named Vikram and a rover
                        named Pragyan, similar to those of the Chandrayaan-2 mission. The propulsion module carried the
                        lander and rover configuration to lunar orbit in preparation for a powered descent by the
                        lander. <br><br>

                        Chandrayaan-3 was launched on 14 July 2023. The spacecraft entered lunar orbit on 5 August, and
                        the lander touched down in the lunar south pole region on 23 August 2023 at 12:32 UTC, making
                        India the fourth country to successfully land on the Moon, and the first to do so near the lunar
                        south pole.

                                On 22 July 2019, ISRO launched Chandrayaan-2 on board a Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM3)
                                launch
                                vehicle consisting of an orbiter, a lander and a rover. The lander was scheduled to
                                touch
                                down on the lunar surface on 6 September 2019 to deploy the Pragyan rover. The lander
                                ultimately
                                crashed when it lost contact with earth (ISRO) and deviated from its intended trajectory
                                while
                                attempting to land near the lunar south pole.
                                <br><br>
                                The lunar South Pole region holds particular interest for scientific exploration due to
                                studies
                                that show large amounts of ice there. Mountainous terrain and unpredictable lighting
                                conditions
                                not only protect the ice from melting, but also make landing scientific probes there a
                                challenging undertaking. This ice could contain solid-state compounds that would
                                normally
                                melt
                                under warmer conditions elsewhere on the Moon, compounds which could provide insight
                                into
                                lunar,
                                Earth, and Solar System history. Ice could also be used as a source of drinking water
                                and
                                hydrogen for fuel and oxygen for future manned missions and outposts.

                                The European Space Tracking network (ESTRACK), operated by the European Space Agency
                                (ESA),
                                is
                                supporting the mission. Under a new cross-support arrangement, ESA tracking support
                                could be

                                Chandrayaan-3 comprises three main components:
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Propulsion module</b>
                                <br>
                                The propulsion module carries the lander and rover configuration to a 100 kilometres (62
                                mi) lunar orbit. It is a box-like structure with a large solar panel mounted on one side
                                and a cylindrical mounting structure for the lander (the Intermodular Adapter Cone) on
                                top.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Lander</b>
                                <br><br>
                                The Vikram lander is responsible for the soft landing on the Moon. It is also
                                box-shaped, with four landing legs and four landing thrusters capable of producing 800
                                newtons of thrust each. It carries the rover and various scientific instruments to
                                perform on-site analysis.
                                <br><br>
                                The lander for Chandrayaan-3 has four variable-thrust engines with slew rate changing
                                capabilities, unlike Chandrayaan-2's lander, which had five, with the fifth one being
                                centrally mounted and capable only of fixed thrust. One of the main reasons for
                                Chandrayaan-2's landing failure was attitude increase during the camera coasting phase.
                                This was removed by allowing the lander to control attitude and thrust during all phases
                                of descent. Attitude correction rate is increased from Chandrayaan-2's 10°/s to 25°/s
                                with Chandrayaan-3. Additionally, the Chandrayaan-3 lander is equipped with a Laser
                                Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) to allow measuring attitude in 3 directions. The
                                impact legs have been made stronger compared to Chandrayaan-2 and instrumentation
                                redundancy has been improved. It will target a more precise 4 km (2.5 mi) by 4 km (2.5
                                mi) landing region based on images previously provided by the Orbiter High-Resolution
                                Camera (OHRC) onboard Chandrayaan-2's orbiter. ISRO improved the structural rigidity,
                                increased polling in instruments, increased data frequency and transmission, and added
                                additional multiple contingency systems to improve lander survivability in the event of
                                failures during descent and landing.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Rover</b>
                                <br><br>
                                The Pragyan rover is a six-wheeled vehicle with a mass of 26 kilograms (57 pounds). It
                                is 917 millimetres (3.009 ft) x 750 millimetres (2.46 ft) x 397 millimetres (1.302 ft)
                                in size.
                                The rover is expected to take multiple measurements to support research into the
                                composition of the lunar surface, the presence of water ice in the lunar soil, the
                                history of lunar impacts, and the evolution of the Moon's atmosphere.

                    <h2>Mars Orbiter Mission(Mangalyan)</h2>
                    <p>The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), unofficially termed as Mangalyaan (from Sanskrit: Mangala, "Mars"
                        and yāna, "craft, vehicle") was a space probe orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014. It was
                        launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It was India's
                        first interplanetary missio and it made ISRO the fourth space agency to achieve Mars orbit,
                        after Roscosmos, NASA, and the European Space Agency. It made India the first Asian nation to
                        reach the Martian orbit and the first nation in the world to do so on its maiden attempt.
                        <br><br>
                        The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space
                        Centre (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)
                        rocket C25 at 09:08 UTC on 5 November 2013. The launch window was approximately 20 days long and
                        started on 28 October 2013. The MOM probe spent about a month in Earth orbit, where it made a
                        series of seven apogee-raising orbital manoeuvres before trans-Mars injection on 30 November
                        2013 (UTC). After a 298-day transit to Mars, it was put into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.

                        The mission was a "technology demonstrator" project to develop the technologies for designing,
                        planning, management, and operations of an interplanetary mission. It carried five scientific
                        instruments. The spacecraft was monitored from the Spacecraft Control Centre at ISRO Telemetry,
                        Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) in Bengaluru with support from the Indian Deep Space
                        Network (IDSN) antennae at Bengaluru, Karnataka.

                        On 2 October 2022, it was reported that the orbiter had irrecoverably lost communications with
                        Earth after entering a seven-hour eclipse period in April 2022 that it was not designed to
                        survive The following day, ISRO released a statement that all attempts to revive MOM had failed
                        and officially declared it dead, citing the loss of fuel and battery power to the probe's
                        instruments.

                            On 23 November 2008, the first public acknowledgement of an uncrewed mission to Mars was
                            announced by then-ISRO chairman G. Madhavan Nair. The MOM mission concept began with a
                            feasibility study in 2010 by the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology after the
                            launch of lunar satellite Chandrayaan-1 in 2008. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh approved the
                            project on 3 August 2012, after the Indian Space Research Organisation completed
                            ₹125 crore (US$16 million) of required studies for the orbiter. The total project cost
                            may be up to ₹454 crore (US$57 million). The satellite costs ₹153 crore (US$19
                            million) and the rest of the budget has been attributed to ground stations and relay
                            upgrades that will be used for other ISRO projects.
                            <br><br>
                            The space agency had planned the launch on 28 October 2013 but was postponed to 5 November
                            following the delay in ISRO's spacecraft tracking ships to take up pre-determined positions
                            due to poor weather in the Pacific Ocean. Launch opportunities for a fuel-saving Hohmann
                            transfer orbit occur every 26 months, in this case the next two would be in 2016 and
                            2018.
                            <br><br>
                            Assembly of the PSLV-XL launch vehicle, designated C25, started on 5 August 2013. The
                            mounting of the five scientific instruments was completed at Indian Space Research
                            Organisation Satellite Centre, Bengaluru, and the finished spacecraft was shipped to
                            Sriharikota on 2 October 2013 for integration to the PSLV-XL launch vehicle. The
                            satellite's development was fast-tracked and completed in a record 15 months, partly due
                            to using reconfigured Chandrayaan-2 orbiter bus. Despite the US federal government
                            shutdown, NASA reaffirmed on 5 October 2013 it would provide communications and navigation
                            support to the mission "with their Deep Space Network facilities.". During a meeting on
                            30 September 2014, NASA and ISRO officials signed an agreement to establish a pathway for
                            future joint missions to explore Mars. One of the working group's objectives will be to
                            explore potential coordinated observations and science analysis between the MAVEN orbiter
                            and MOM, as well as other current and future Mars missions.

                            survive. At the time of communications loss it was unknown whether the probe had lost power
                            or inadvertently realigned its Earth-facing antenna during automatic maneuvers.

                    <h2>Gaganyaan</h2>
                    <p>Gaganyaan (from Sanskrit: gagana, "celestial" and yāna, "craft, vehicle") is an Indian crewed
                        orbital spacecraft intended to be the formative spacecraft of the Indian Human Spaceflight
                        Programme. The spacecraft is being designed to carry three people, and a planned upgraded
                        version will be equipped with rendezvous and docking capabilities. In its maiden crewed mission,
                        the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)'s largely autonomous 5.3-metric ton capsule will
                        orbit the Earth at 400 km altitude for up to seven days with a two- or three-person crew on
                        board. The first crewed mission was originally planned to be launched on ISRO's LVM3 in December
                        2021, but this has since been delayed to no earlier than 2025.
                        <br><br>

                        The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL)-manufactured crew module underwent its first uncrewed
                        experimental flight on 18 December 2014. As of May 2019, design of the crew module has been
                        completed. Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) will provide support for
                        critical human-centric systems and technologies such as space-grade food, crew healthcare,
                        radiation measurement and protection, parachutes for the safe recovery of the crew module, and
                        the fire suppression system.
                        <br><br>
                        On June 11, 2020, it was announced that the first uncrewed Gaganyaan launch would be delayed due
                        to the COVID-19 pandemic in India.The overall timeline for crewed launches was expected to
                        remain unaffected. ISRO chairman S. Somanath announced on June 30, 2022, that the first crewed
                        mission will not take place until 2024 at the earliest because of safety concerns. However, a
                        source in April 2023 suggested that ISRO was aiming for a 2025 launch

                        <br>
                        <p>Preliminary studies and technological development of Gaganyaan started in 2006 under the
                            generic
                            name "Orbital Vehicle". The plan was to design a simple capsule with an endurance of about a
                            week in space, a capacity of two astronauts, and a splashdown landing after re-entry. The
                            project was commissioned in 2007, with expected completion by 2024 and a budget of around
                            ₹10,000 crore. The design was finalized by March 2008 and submitted to the Government of
                            India for funding. The government's funding for the Indian Human Spaceflight Program was
                            sanctioned in February 2009, But it fell short due to limited developmental funding.
                            Initially, the first uncrewed flight of the orbital vehicle was proposed to be in 2013, Then
                            it was revised to 2016. However, in April 2012, it was reported that funding problems placed
                            the future of the project in serious doubt; And in August 2013, it was announced that all
                            crewed spaceflight efforts by India had been designated as being "off ISRO's priority list".
                            By early 2014, the project had been reconsidered and was one of the main beneficiaries of a
                            substantial budget increase announced in February 2014. ISRO is developing the Gaganyaan
                            orbital vehicle based on the tests performed with their scaled 550 kg Space Capsule Recovery
                            Experiment (SRE), which was launched and recovered in January 2007.
                            <br><br>
                            The latest push for the Indian Human Spaceflight Program took place in 2017, And it was
                            accepted and formally announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his 2018 Independence

                            address to the nation.The current design calls for a crew of three. ISRO will perform
                            four biological and two physical science experiments related to microgravity during the
                            Gaganyaan mission. ISRO is planning to replace hydrazine with green propellant on Gaganyaan
                            missions, for which Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) is already working on a
                            monopropellant blended formulation consisting of hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN), ammonium
                            nitrate, methanol and water.
                            <br><br>
                            As of October 2021, ISRO selected five science experiments that will be conducted on
                            Gaganyaan.
                            The payloads will be developed by the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology
                            (IIST),
                            University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad (UASD), Tata Institute of Fundamental Research
                            (TIFR), IIT Patna, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) and the Jawaharlal Nehru
                            Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR). Out of the five, two are biological
                            experiments that will be conducted by IIST, UASD and TIFR and will include kidney stone
                            formation and Sirtuin 1 gene marker effects in Drosophila melanogaster. IIT Patna will run

                        <p>A crewed spacecraft would require about ₹12,400 crore (US$1.77 billion) over a period of
                            seven years, including the ₹5,000 crore (US$0.7 billion) for the initial work of the crewed
                            spacecraft during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007–2012) out of which the Government
                            released ₹ 50 crore (US$7 million) in 2007–2008. In December 2018, the government approved a
                            further ₹10,000 crore (US$1.5 billion) for a 7-day crewed flight of 3 astronauts to take
                            place by 2021.

                            Madhavan Chandradathan, director of Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), stated that ISRO
                            would need to set up an astronaut training facility in Bangalore. The newly established
                            Human Space Flight Centre (HSFC) will coordinate the IHSF efforts. Existing launch
                            facilities will be upgraded for launches under the Indian Human Spaceflight project With
                            extra facilities needed for launch escape systems. Russia is likely to provide astronaut
                            training. In Spring 2009, the full-scale mock-up of the crew capsule of Gaganyaan was built
                            and delivered to Satish Dhawan Space Center for the training of astronauts.

                            India has already successfully developed and tested several building blocks, including
                            re-entry space capsule, pad abort test, safe crew ejection mechanism in case of rocket
                            failure, a flight suit developed by Defence Bioengineering and Electromedical Laboratory
                            (DEBEL) and the powerful GSLV-MkIII launch vehicle. Having met all required technological
                            keystones, the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme was accepted and formally announced by the
                            Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 15 August 2018. Gaganyaan will be the first crewed
                            spacecraft under this programme.

                            ISRO's Human Space Flight Centre and Glavcosmos, which is a subsidiary of the Russian state
                            corporation Roscosmos, signed an agreement on 1 July 2019 for cooperation in the selection,
                            support, medical examination and space training of Indian astronauts. An ISRO Technical
                            Liaison Unit (ITLU) has been approved to be set up in Moscow for coordination.Glavkosmos has
                            also contracted NPP Zvezda for manufacturing customized IVA flight-suits for Indian
                            astronauts. ISRO is planning to develop a ground station for Gaganyaan mission at Cocos
                            (Keeling) Islands, and after a brief discussion with Australian Space Agency, a temporary
                            ground station for the mission has been set up by ISRO in Cocos (Keeling) Islands, as of
                            2021.</p>

                        <p>Crew module
                            Gaganyaan crew module is a fully autonomous 5.3 t (12,000 lb) spacecraft designed to carry a
                            3-member crew to orbit and safely return to the Earth after a mission duration of up to
                            seven days. The crew module is equipped with two parachutes for redundancy, while one
                            parachute is good enough for safe splashdown. The parachutes would reduce the speed of the
                            crew module from over 216 m/s (710 ft/s) to under 11 m/s (36 ft/s) at splashdown.

                            The space capsule will have life support and environmental control systems. It will be
                            equipped with emergency mission abort capabilities and a Crew Escape System (CES) that can
                            be activated during the first stage or second rocket stage burn. The nose of the original
                            version of the orbital vehicle was free for a docking mechanism, but primary entry was
                            evidently through a side hatch secured by explosive bolts. On 7 December 2022, The Hindu
                            reported that the crew module had entered the production stage.

                    <h2>Aditya-L1</h2>
                    <p>Aditya L1 is a planned coronagraphy spacecraft to study solar atmosphere, currently being
                        designed and developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and various other Indian
                        research institutes. It will be inserted in a halo orbit around the L1 point between the
                        Earth and the Sun where it will study the solar atmosphere, solar magnetic storms and its impact
                        on environment around Earth. <br><br>

                        Key scientific objectives are coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, coronal magnetometry,
                        origin and monitoring of near-UV solar radiation and the continuous observation of photosphere,
                        chromosphere and corona, solar energetic particles and magnetic field of the Sun.
                        <br><br>
                        It is the first Indian mission dedicated to observe the Sun, and is scheduled to be launched
                        aboard a PSLV-XL launch vehicle on 2 September 2023.

                            The Aditya-L1 mission will take around 109 Earth days after launch to reach the halo
                            orbit around the L1 point, which is about 1,500,000 km (930,000 mi) from Earth. The 1,500 kg
                            (3,300 lb) satellite carries seven science payloads with diverse objectives, including but
                            not limited to, the coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, coronal magnetometry, origin
                            and monitoring of near-UV solar radiation (which drives Earth's upper atmospheric dynamics
                            and global climate), coupling of the solar photosphere to chromosphere and corona, in-situ
                            characterisations of the space environment around Earth by measuring energetic particle
                            fluxes and magnetic fields of the solar wind and solar magnetic storms that have adverse
                            effects on space and ground-based technologies.
                            <br><br>
                            Aditya-L1 will be able to provide observations of Sun's photosphere, chromosphere and
                            corona. In addition, an instrument will study the solar energetic particles' flux reaching
                            the L1 orbit, while a magnetometer payload will measure the variation in magnetic field
                            strength at the halo orbit around L1. These payloads have to be placed outside the
                            interference from the Earth's magnetic field and hence could not have been useful in the low
                            Earth orbit as proposed on the original Aditya mission concept.
                            <br><br>
                            One of the major unsolved issues in the field of solar physics is that the upper atmosphere
                            of the Sun is 1,000,000 K (1,000,000 °C; 1,800,000 °F) hot whereas the lower atmosphere is
                            just 6,000 K (5,730 °C; 10,340 °F). In addition, it is not understood how exactly the Sun's
                            radiation affects the dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere on shorter as well as on longer
                            time scale. The mission will obtain near simultaneous images of the different layers of the
                            Sun's atmosphere, which reveal the ways in which the energy may be channeled and transferred
                            from one layer to another. Thus the Aditya-L1 mission will enable a comprehensive
                            understanding of the dynamical processes of the Sun and address some of the outstanding
                            problems in solar physics and heliophysics.
