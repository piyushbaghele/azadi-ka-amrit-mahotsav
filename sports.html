                <br>
                    Sports is an extremely important component for the overall development of our nation. India, in the
                    last few years has made steady progress in the field of sports. This tremendous potential needs to
                    be showcased at a global platform. It’s time we inspire young talent, give them top-notch
                    infrastructure and training of the highest level. We need to inculcate a strong spirit of
                    participation in sports that enables players to demonstrate their true potential. Only then can
                    India realise its dream of becoming a sports super power.
                    <br><br>
                    The Khelo India programme has been introduced to revive the sports culture in India at the
                    grass-root level by building a strong framework for all sports played in our country and establish
                    India as a great sporting nation.

                    The Khelo India Youth Games 2023 will be held in Madhya Pradesh from January 30 to February 11,
                    2023.
                    It will be the fifth edition of the flagship event under the government of India’s Khelo India
                    initiative, which promotes sports at the grassroots levels in the country. KIYG 2023 can be seen on
                    live streaming and live telecast in India.
                    <br><br>
                    The last edition of the KIYG, Khelo India Youth Games 2021, was postponed thrice due to COVID-19
                    before finally being held in June last year. Consequently, the 2022 edition is being held in 2023.

                    Over 5,000 athletes from the 36 states and Union Territories will compete for 1,936 medals - 573
                    gold, 580 silver and 783 bronze - in 27 sports at the Khelo India Youth Games.

                    The host state of Madhya Pradesh will boast the largest contingent of 474 athletes at the Khelo
                    India Youth Games 2023. Haryana, the defending champions, will have the second-largest contingent in
                    action. Tripura will have the smallest, a 13-athlete contingent at KIYG 2023.

                    <h1>Diamond League</h1>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra obtained the top spot in Lausanne Diamond League 2023 with a
                        best throw of 87.66 m on Friday. The star Indian player is coming back from a muscle injury he
                        had sustained during training. The injury forced Chopra to withdraw from three events in the
                        month of June namely FBK Games, Paavo Nurmi Games and the Ostrava Golden Spike.
                        <br><br>
                        Neeraj Chopra looked a little out of sorts on his first attempt, which was ruled a foul. He
                        opened his account with a throw of 83.52m in his second attempt, which put him in third place
                        behind Julian Weber (86.20m) and Jakub Vadlejch (84.71m)
                        <br><br>
                        Chopra moved into second place with a throw of 85.04m on his third attempt, just behind Weber,
                        and had the chance to take the lead on his fourth attempt. However, the 25-year-old failed to
                        make a mark on his fourth attempt.
                        <br><br>
                        The Indian ace player finally eventually took the lead with a throw of 87.66m in the fifth
                        round. Germany's Julian Weber clinched the second spot with a throw of 87.03m and Tokyo Olympics
                        Silver medallist Jakub Vadlejch took the third spot with a 86.13m throw in his final attempt.
                        <br><br>
                        After the victory at the Lausanne Diamond League, Chopra told organizers, “I was feeling a bit
                        nervous coming back from an injury. It was a bit cold here tonight. I am still far from my best,
                        but I feel it is getting better. I am relieved it´s coming together well for me. A win is a win
                        and I will take that happily."

                    <h1>Pragg in FIDE Finals</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa vs Magnus Carlsen, Chess World Cup 2023 Final As It Happened: After
                        three days and four games of intensely nervy chess across two formats, Magnus Carlsen finally
                        managed to win the FIDE World Cup for the first time in his career on Thursday. He defeated
                        India’s Praggnanandhaa in the final, but not before the 18-year-old teenage prodigy had dragged
                        him through the tie-breaker. Carlsen’s win was confirmed after the second game of the
                        tiebreaker. The two players had played out one draw each on Tuesday and Wednesday.
                        <br><br>

                        Regardless of the final loss, the FIDE World Cup has been an event to savour for the teenager
                        from Chennai since he also sealed a spot at the prestigious Candidates Tournament, which is held
                        to find a challenger for world champion Ding Liren at the next world chess championship battle.

                    <p>It was not just a trophy that Igor Stimac and his men brought the country when they followed up
                        their Tri Nation Cup win in March with the Intercontinental Cup on Sunday. Their 2-0 win over
                        higher-ranked Lebanon in the final in Bhubaneswar also ensured a climb back into the top 100 of
                        FIFA rankings and added a leaf in the record books as their sixth consecutive clean-sheet broke
                        a record set by the national team in 1951-52, under the guidance of Syed Abdul Rahim. <br><br>
                        Sunil Chhetri had scored a brace when India won by the Intercontinental Cup in 2018 and the
                        skipper broke the deadlock at Kalinga Stadium in the 46th minute only for Player-of-the-Match
                        Lallianzuala Chhangte, who had provided the assist for the first, to put the game beyond Lebanon
                        with a 66th-minute strike.</p>

                        defending champions Colombia 220-216 to enter the title clash. Earlier, the Indian women’s
                        compound team defeated Chinese Taipei and Turkey in the quarter-finals and the
